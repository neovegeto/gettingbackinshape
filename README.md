# GettingBackInShape
After moving countries, learning a new language and writing application, I am a little bit rusted with Data Analysis. This is my try to do random stuff with open available Data. Nothing fancy. 

Taking a Dataset, Analyses it, Cleaning, Graphic, SQL, maybe even Tableau.

This will be mostly a work in progress.
I will use the folders to seperate the projects.

First Project: steam_games_dataset
A Dataset from Kaggle. I will use Python, SQL and maybe Tableau
