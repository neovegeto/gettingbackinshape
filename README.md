# GettingBackInShape

After moving countries, learning a new language and writing application, I am a little bit rusted with Data Analysis. This is my try to do random stuff with open available Data. Nothing fancy.

Taking a Dataset, Analyses it, Cleaning, Graphic, SQL, maybe even Tableau.

This will be mostly a work in progress.
I will use the folders to seperate the projects.

1. First Project: steam_games_dataset
   A Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset?resource=download). I will use Python, SQL and maybe Tableau.
   So far I created 4 different Workbooks with different approaches.
   Conclusion: The Dataset is not worth for creating Top3/5/10 - Lists. Is a boring task and not the best Data for Task, just in case you wanted to find your next game for upcoming Steam-Sale.
   The better Task was to find out "why the Data is actually "garbage". A lot of visualisations in Python helped with that. I found no further value in operating with Tableau.
